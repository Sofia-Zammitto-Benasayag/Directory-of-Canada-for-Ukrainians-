# Directory-of-Canada-for-Ukrainians-
Directory of resources in Canada for Ukrainians/ Довідник ресурсів Канади для українців


A simple directory of housing, jobs, help settling in for each Canadian province. Also groups where people offers jobs, housing, donate items
such as mattresses, strollers. And much, much more. You can find a lot of support and information on there.

This is a growing project to create an international directory for Ukrainians and people fleeing the war.

Feel free to contribute your countries’ and cities’ resources. Also it needs a lot of help aesthetically, but I know this information is time-sensitive.

Coders can contribute on the GitHub repo❤️. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. 
Thank you! & #glorytoukraine 🇺🇦💪
